# Optimal Portfolio Variance Analysis

This project demonstrates the calculation of the optimal portfolio variance using 10 years of historical data for 10 selected stocks. It was developed as part of the Worthon Financial Modeling Capstone on Coursera.

## Project Overview

- *Objective:*  
  To determine the optimal portfolio with the minimum variance using historical stock data.

- *Data:*  
  10 years of historical data for 10 stocks.

- *Methodology:*  
  - Data cleaning and preparation in Excel.
  - Calculation of portfolio variance.
  - Analysis of the efficient frontier.

- *Tools:*  
  - Microsoft Excel
  - Data Analysis techniques

## Files Included

- Optimal_portfolio_varience.xlsx – The Excel workbook containing the analysis and calculations.
- README.md – This file, which provides an overview of the project.

## How to Use

1. *Download the File:*  
   Click the "View Project" button on the portfolio website to download the Excel file.

2. *Open the Workbook:*  
   Open the Optimal_portfolio_varience.xlsx file in Microsoft Excel.

3. *Review the Analysis:*  
   The workbook contains step-by-step calculations, formulas, and graphs that detail how the optimal portfolio variance was determined.

## Future Work

- *Automation:*  
  Consider automating the analysis using programming languages such as Python or R.
  
- *Model Enhancement:*  
  Expand the analysis by including additional stocks and exploring other risk metrics.
